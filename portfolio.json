  "summary": "I am a Computational biologist driven by the fervent belief that biological understanding can be advanced through the transformative power of computational and statistical methods. In my current research, I focus on using and developing computational tools to integrate disease-associated variation with transcriptomics data for identifying biomarkers of disease. As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am constantly looking for opportunities to advance scientific knowledge and improve public health and scientific knowledge",
